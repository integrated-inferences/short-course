## A hoop test justified with data.

Sometimes we treat the absence of an expected mediator as strong evidence against a proposition. 
In this exercise we will try to *justify* a claim of this form:


1. Define a model in which $X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y$ but do *not* impose any other restrictions
2. Imagine you saw 20 cases in which $X$ and $M$ are very highly correlated and $M$ and $Y$ are very highly correlated. Generate data like this and update the model.
3. Now imagine you saw a case in which $X=1$ and $Y=1$. What should you believe about the probability that $X$ caused $Y$?
3. Now imagine you saw in addition that $M=1$. What should you believe about the probability that $X$ caused $Y$?
4. Now imagine you saw instead that $M=0$. What should you believe about the probability that $X$ caused $Y$?


# A smoking gun test
**(30 minutes)**

Can you construct another model and background data that lets you treat $K$ as a smoking gun evidnece for the $X$ causing $Y$?
