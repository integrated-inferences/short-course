## Start with a DAG

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1),
       y = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4),
       names = c("X", expression(theta^X), expression(lambda^X), "Y", expression(theta^Y), expression(lambda^Y), "M", expression(theta^M), expression(lambda^M)),
       arcs = cbind( c(3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1),
                     c(2, 1, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 8, 4)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* We'll want to learn about the $\theta$'s and the $\lambda$'s
* We need to observe nodes to learn about other nodes
* We can potentially observe 3 nodes here: $X, M$, and $Y$


## A typical "quantitative" data structure

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1),
       y = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4),
       names = c("I", expression(theta^I), expression(lambda^I), "D", expression(theta^D), expression(lambda^D), "M", expression(theta^M), expression(lambda^M)),
       arcs = cbind( c(3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1),
                     c(2, 1, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 8, 4)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```


* Data on exogenous variables and a key outcome for many cases

* E.g., data on inequality ($I$) and democracy ($D$) for many cases


## A typical "quantitative" data structure

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="320px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/quantdata.png")
```



##  A typical "quantitative" data structure

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2),
       y = c(2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4),
       names = c(
         "I", 
         expression(paste(theta^I)),
         "M",
         expression(paste(theta^M)), 
         "D", 
         expression(paste(theta^D)),
         "P",
         expression(paste(theta^P))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 7, 8),
                     c(5, 1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 5, 7)),
       # title = "A Simple DAG",
       padding = .4, contraction = .15) 

```
* Or maybe data on inequality, democracy, and international pressure for many cases


## A typical "qualitative" data structure

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1),
       y = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4),
       names = c("I", expression(theta^I), expression(lambda^I), "D", expression(theta^D), expression(lambda^D), "M", expression(theta^M), expression(lambda^M)),
       arcs = cbind( c(3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1),
                     c(2, 1, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 8, 4)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Data on exogenous variables and a key outcome plus elements of process for a **small** number of cases
    * Finite resources mean tradeoffs between extensive and intensive data collection

* E.g., data on inequality ($I$), mass mobilization ($M$), and democracy ($D$) for many cases

## A typical "qualitative" data structure

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="320px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/qualdata.png")
```


## Mixing qualitative and quantitative

* What if we combine extensive data on many cases with intensive data on a few cases?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="320px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/mixeddata.png")
```

* A non-rectangular data structure

## Non-rectangular data

* A data structure that neither standard quantitative nor standard qualitative approaches can handle in a systematic way
* Not a problem for the Integrated Inferences approach
* We simply ask: 
    * Which causal effects in the population are most and least consistent with the data pattern we observe?
* That is, what distribution of causal effects in the population, for each node, are most consistent with this data pattern?
* CausalQueries uses information wherever it finds it



## How qual can inform quant: confounding

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/confounding.png")
```

Remember:
* Say we just observe a positive Inequality-Democratization correlation
* Could be because Inequality causes Democratization
* Could be because of confounding


## How qual can inform quant: confounding

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/confounding.png")
```

Remember
* Observing $M$ helps
* **Process data helps address the deep problem of confounding**
* Key point: we don't need $M$ for all cases
    * Can learn from $I$ and $D$ for lots of cases and $M$ for a subset

## How qual can inform quant: observable confounder

* Another example: $M$ as the confound 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 1, 2),
       y = c(2, 3, 2),
       names = c(
         "X", 
         "M",
         "Y" 
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(2, 1),
                     c(2, 3)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15) 

```


## How qual can inform quant: observable confounder

* How much can we learn from $M$ data for *some* cases?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="300px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/widedeep.png")
```


## How quant can inform qual: getting probative value of a clue from the data

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.8\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1),
       y = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2),
       names = c("I", expression(theta^I), "D", expression(theta^D), "M", expression(theta^M)), 
       arcs = cbind( c(2, 1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1, 5, 3, 5, 3)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Suppose we go to the field and we learn that mass mobilization DID occur in Malawi
    * So $M=1$

* What can we conclude?

* NOTHING YET!

## How quant can inform qual: getting probative value of a clue from the data

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align="center", out.width='.8\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1),
       y = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2),
       names = c("I", expression(theta^I), "D", expression(theta^D), "M", expression(theta^M)), 
       arcs = cbind( c(2, 1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1, 5, 3, 5, 3)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```


* The pure process-tracing solution: assign our beliefs about causal effects in the population
    * E.g., beliefs that linked positive effects are more likely than linked negative effects
    * Meaning that $M=1$ in an $I=1, D=1$ case speaks in favor of $I=1$ causing $D=1$
* The mixed-methods solution: **learn** about population-level effects from large-$N$ data

## How quant can inform qual: getting probative value of a clue from the data

* Suppose we have data on $I$, D$, and $M$ for a large number of cases
* Suppose we observe a strong positive correlation across all 3 variables
* What have we learned, under this model?
    * Positive $I \rightarrow M$ effects more likely than negative
    * Positive $M \rightarrow D$ effects more likely than negative
* So **linked positive effects** more common than linked negative effects
* Meaning that $M=1$ in an $I=1, D=1$ case speaks in favor of $I=1$ causing $D=1$
* But now we've now drawn our population-level beliefs **from the data**
* Now, we can go and process-trace
    * Did high inequality cause democratization in Malawi?
    * Observe $M$
* With conclusions grounded in case-level AND population-level evidence
