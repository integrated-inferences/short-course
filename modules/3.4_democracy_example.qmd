```{r, include = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
library(knitr)
library(CausalQueries)
source("assets/setup.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Application

* We take a problem over which there is substantial theoretical debate and in which scholars have sought explicitly to apply process tracing strategies.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

## Setting restrictions

* Monotonicity of $I$'s effect on $M$: no negative effect
* Monotonicity of $I$'s direct effect on $D$: no positive effect
* Monotonicity of $M$’s effect on $D$: no negative effect
* Monotonicity of $P$’s effect on $D$: no negative effect

## Where do these prior beliefs come from?

* Literature
    * We draw on leading works on inequality and democratization (Boix, Acemoglu and Robinson, Ansell and Samuels)

Could also come from:
    
* Deductive theorization
    * E.g., a formal model (see Chapter 6.3)
    
* Crowd-sourcing
    * Survey experts
    
* Important: we cannot read causal beliefs directly off population-level descriptives
    * E.g., the number of $I=1, M=1$ cases tells us nothing about how often inequality *causes* mobilization

## Process tracing results for several cases

* With different possible clues we could observe

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/ptmanyex.png")
```



## Process tracing to answer a pathway question

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* Similar idea for answering a pathway question
* Observing $M$ can help us figure out *how* $I$ caused $D$
* Once we provide population-level beliefs about causal effects

## Other pieces of evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* $P$ can also be informative about $I$'s effect on $D$
* Will depend on our population-level beliefs about $P$'s effects on $D$ and interactions with $M$
