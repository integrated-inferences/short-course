## By hand: Procedure

1. Make a table with rows for all causal types (there may be many if you are doing by hand!!)
2. Add  a column to indicate your priors over these causal type
3. Add a column to say if the query is satisfied by the causal types
4. Calculate the conditional distributions given the types


## By hand: Example

Our DAG is:

$X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y$

And we believe:

* $X=1$ for half the cases, randomly
* $X$ has a positive effect on $M$ for half the cases ("causes"), in the other half $M=0$ regardless of $X$
* $M$ has a positive effect on $Y$ for half the cases, in the other half $Y=0$ regardless of $M$


## By hand: Example {.smaller}

What are the types? How likely is each one? How likely is each given the data?

* Which ones satisfy the following query: $Y = 0$ *because* $X=0$?:
* Which ones are consistent with data: $X = 0, Y = 0$

| Type                                                     | X | M | Y | prob | Query? | Data ? |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---|---|---|------|--------|--------|
| X = 0, X causes M, M causes Y                             | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  | ✓      | ✓      |
| X = 0, X causes M, M does not cause Y                     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  |        | ✓      |
| X = 0, X does not cause M, M causes Y                     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  |        | ✓      |
| X = 0, X does not cause M, M does not cause Y             | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  |        | ✓      |
| X = 1, X causes M, M causes Y                             | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1/8  |        |        |
| X = 1, X causes M, M does not cause Y                     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1/8  |        |        |
| X = 1, X does not cause M, M causes Y                     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  |        |        |
| X = 1, X does not cause M, M does not cause Y             | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1/8  |        |        |


## With CausalQueries: Step 1

Define a model

```{r, echo = TRUE}

model <- 
  make_model("X -> M -> Y") |>
  set_restrictions("M[X = 0] == 1") |>
  set_restrictions("Y[M = 0] == 1")

query <- "Y[X=1] > Y[X=0]"
```

## With CausalQueries: Step 2

Get types consistent with query

```{r}
get_query_types(model, query)

```

## With CausalQueries: Step 3


Get mapping from causal types to consistent data types

```{r}
inspect(model, what = "ambiguities_matrix") 
```

## With CausalQueries: Step 4

Get prior probabilities of each causal type

```{r}
CausalQueries:::get_type_prob(model)

```

## Put it all together

```{r}
model  |>
  grab(what = "ambiguities_matrix") |>
  data.frame() |>
  mutate(
    in_query = get_query_types(model, query)$types,
    priors   = CausalQueries:::get_type_prob(model)) |>
  kable()
```

## In one go with CausalQueries

```{r, echo = TRUE}
query_model(model, query, given = c("X==0 & M ==0 & Y == 0"))
```

# Democratization example



```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

## Setting restrictions

* Monotonicity of $I$'s effect on $M$: no negative effect
* Monotonicity of $I$'s direct effect on $D$: no positive effect
* Monotonicity of $M$’s effect on $D$: no negative effect
* Monotonicity of $P$’s effect on $D$: no negative effect

## Where do these prior beliefs come from?

* Literature
    * We draw on leading works on inequality and democratization (Boix, Acemoglu and Robinson, Ansell and Samuels)

Could also come from:
    
* Deductive theorization
    * E.g., a formal model (see Chapter 6.3)
    
* Crowd-sourcing
    * Survey experts
    
* Important: we cannot read causal beliefs directly off population-level descriptives
    * E.g., the number of $I=1, M=1$ cases tells us nothing about how often inequality *causes* mobilization

## Process tracing results for several cases

* With different possible clues we could observe

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/ptmanyex.png")
```



## Process tracing to answer a pathway question

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* Similar idea for answering a pathway question
* Observing $M$ can help us figure out *how* $I$ caused $D$
* Once we provide population-level beliefs about causal effects

## Other pieces of evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* $P$ can also be informative about $I$'s effect on $D$
* Will depend on our population-level beliefs about $P$'s effects on $D$ and interactions with $M$
