## Let's start with a DAG: Inequality and Democratization (through Mobilization)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

Key idea is that: *if* you believe this model, then seeing $M$ should tell you something about the $X$, $Y$ relationship.

## Crucial to keep in mind

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Great as this is, the DAG tells us nothing about the *direction* of effects
* Inequality might boost or depress mobilization
* Mobilization might encourage or delay democratization

<!-- * Put differently, we haven't said anything about the $\theta$ values -->



## How we're conceiving of process tracing

* We are focusing on a case

* We start knowing *something* about the case
    * Perhaps the outcome
    * Perhaps the value of a causal condition or two
    
* What we don't know is whether any of those conditions *caused* the outcome

* So we collect *more* information "from other parts of the DAG"  to help figure that out


## Formulating a case-level question: Malawi (1994)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Suppose we observe democratization as the outcome in Malawi: $D=1$

* We also observe high inequality in Malawi: $I=1$

* We want to know: did $I=1$ cause $D=1$ in Malawi?


## A simple process-tracing strategy

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* We start out knowing $I=1$ and $D=1$

* We ask: did $I=1$ cause $D=1$?

* Let's process trace: observe $M$ in Malawi
    * Was there mass mobilization in Malawi?


## Collect the process tracing evidence ($M$)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Suppose we go to the field and we learn that mass mobilization DID occur in Malawi
    * So $M=1$

* What can we conclude?

* NOTHING YET!


## Why the DAG is not enough

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* We knew $I=1$, $D=1$

* We then saw $M=1$

* But which is more consistent with $I=1$ causing $D=1$?
    * Mobilization occurring? or
    * Mobilization not occurring?


## Why the DAG is not enough

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Suppose I believe that high inequality usually **prevents** mass mobilization
    * Poverty makes it harder to mobilize
    
* Suppose I also believe that mobilization usually **prevents** democratization
    * Instills fear in autocrats and provokes repression
    
* Which value of $M$ would be most consistent with $I=1$ causing $D=1$?
    * $M=0$

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),
       names = c("I", "D", "M"), 
       arcs = cbind( c(1, 3),
                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* Suppose I believe that high inequality usually **causes** mass mobilization
    * Inequality creates grievances for protest
    
* Suppose I also believe that mobilization usually **causes** democratization
    * Instills fear in autocrats and provokes concessions
    
* Which value of $M$ would be most consistent with $I=1$ causing $D=1$?
    * $M=1$

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3,  fig.align = "center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
hj_dag(x = c(0, 2, 1),
       y = c(1, 1, 1),

                     c(3, 2)),
       padding = .4, contraction = .15)

```

* If I believe inequality usually causes democratization by preventing mobilization, which itself hinders democratization...
    * then observing $M=0$ constitutes evidence that $I=1$ caused $D=1$

* If I believe inequality usually causes democratization by causing mobilization, which itself causes democratization...
    * then observing $M=1$ constitutes evidence that $I=1$ caused $D=1$


## Process tracing is always theory dependent

* The evidence in process tracing never speaks for itself

* Our inferences from PT evidence always depend on theory
    * On our beliefs about how the world works
    
* Most process tracing is either silent about these beliefs or expresses them informally

* We can formalize these beliefs
    * Maximize explicitness and analytic transparency


## Process tracing is distinguishing among theories {.smaller}

An example:

* The Lord of the Manor has been shot. Did the butler do it?
* Two theories of how he might have done so
    * Theory 1: He might have shot the Lord himself
        * We start out thinking this is a *likely* mechanism
    * Theory 2: He might have hired an assassin
        * We start out thinking this is an *unlikely* mechanism

## Distinguishing theories {.smaller}

* We find a piece of evidence
    * The bullet is from a Beretta 92FS
    * Commonly used by professional killers -- rarely used by general population
* This strengthens belief in Theory 2, weakens belief in Theory 1 -- *if the butler did it*
* But overall this evidence makes us *less* confident the butler did it at all!
    * Because it supports a very *unlikely* theory of how he'd have done it and undermines a likely theory


## Distinguishing theories

* Often there are multiple ways in which some statement could be true
    * E.g., there are multiple mechanisms through which $I$ could have a positive effect on $D$
    * Linked positive effects, or
    * Linked negative effects
* Those different ways are not equally likely, though
    * Maybe linked positive effects are much more likely than linked negative effects as ways of making "I has a positive effect on D" a true statement
* Evidence that we collect will tell us which "ways" are more likely operating in a case


## Distinguishing theories

* When the evidence shifts our beliefs toward thinking that a *likely* theory/mechanism for some cause is operating, that makes it more likely that the cause is operating
* When evidence shifts our beliefs away from thinking that a *likely* theory/mechanism for some cause is operating and toward thinking an *unlikely* theory/pathway is operating, that makes it **less likely** that the cause is operating
* **We "lose" more by undermining the likely mechanism than we gain by boosting the unlikely mechanism**
* So it matters how likely we think the different possible mechanisms are
    * Will affect how we interpret the evidence
* These are "priors"

## Two theories of how $I=1$ could cause $D=1$

* Chain of positive effects 
    * Inequality *boosts* mobilization
    * Mobilization *causes* democratization
    
* Chain of negative effects
    * Inequality *depresses* mobilization
    * Mobilization *prevents* democratization
    
    
## Interpretation of PT evidence *depends* on theory

In particular: beliefs about which mechanism is most likely operating

If we have already seen $I=1, D=1$    

* Linked positive effects requires us to then see: $M=1$

* Linked negative effects requires us to then see: $M=0$

* So which $M$ value is more consistent with a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect depends on **which of these is more common in the world**:
    * Linked positive effects?
    * Linked negative effects?

* We need to draw on our theoretical beliefs
    * about the **distribution** of causal effects in the relevant population

## Combining beliefs across the DAG

* Suppose we believe that:
    * $I$ has a positive effect on $M$ 30% of the time (= in 30% of cases in the population)
    * $I$ has a negative effect on $M$ 10% of the time 

* Suppose we believe that:
    * $M$ has a positive effect on $D$ 60% of the time
    * $M$ has a negative effect on $D$ 10% of the time

* Then the probability of linked positive effects is simply...
    * $0.3 \times 0.6 = 0.18$
    
* Probability of linked negative effects is simply...
    * $0.1 \times 0.1 = 0.01$
    
* So we believe linked positive effects are a MUCH more common way of generating a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect than linked negative effects



## From beliefs to the meaning of the evidence

* We believe linked positive effects are a MUCH more common way of generating a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect than linked negative effects

* Given $I=1$ and $D=1$, there can only be linked positive effects IF mobilization occurs ($M=1$)

* So if we observe $M=1$, we will think it's more likely that high inequality DID cause democratization
    * Because $M=1$ is consistent with the MORE likely way this effect could have happened

* If we observe $M=0$, we think it's less likely that high inequality caused democratization
    * Because $M=0$ is consistent only with the LESS likely way this effect could have happened
  

## How the meaning of the evidence hinges on beliefs

Alternatively...

* Suppose we believe that:
    * $I$ has a positive effect on $M$ 20% of the time (= in 30% of cases in the population)
    * $I$ has a negative effect on $M$ 20% of the time 

* Suppose we believe that:
    * $M$ has a positive effect on $D$ 10% of the time
    * $M$ has a negative effect on $D$ 60% of the time

* Probability of linked positive effects is...
    * $0.2 \times 0.1 = 0.02$
    
* Probability of linked negative effects is...
    * $0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12$

* Now linked negative effects are a MUCH more common way of generating a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect than linked positive effects

* Under these theoretical beliefs, $M=0$ would be more consistent than $M=1$ with a positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect


## Process tracing in Malawi

To recap:

* We want to know if $I=1$ caused $D=1$ in Malawi

* Given our DAG, there are two ways to generate a positive effects of $I$ on $D$
    * Two ways that high inequality could have caused democratization in Malawi
    * Linked positive effects or linked negative effects
    
* When we see $M=1$ in Malawi, what we should conclude about $I$'s effect on $D$ depends on how we think the world works
    * What kinds of effects do we think are most common at each step
    
* This defines what **ways** of generating a positive $I \rightarrow D$ are most/least common

* Which tells us which value of $M$ is most consistent with such an effect


## Process tracing in Malawi

* Prior beliefs we use in the book (roughly):
    * $I$ has positive effect on $M$ 50% of the time    
    * $I$ never has a negative effect on $M$
    * $M$ has positive effect on $D$ 50% of the time
    * $M$ never has a negative effect on $D$

* We process trace and observe that mobilization occurred: $M=1$

* Given our priors, this observation **increases** our confidence that $I=1$ caused $D=1$


## Where do these prior beliefs come from?

* Literature
    * We draw on leading works on inequality and democratization (Boix, Acemoglu and Robinson, Ansell and Samuels)
    
* Deductive theorization
    * E.g., a formal model (see Chapter 6.3)
    
* Crowd-sourcing
    * Survey experts
    
* Cannot read directly off population-level descriptives
    * E.g., the number of $I=1, M=1$ cases tells us nothing about how often inequality *causes* mobilization


## Process tracing for several cases

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

## Process tracing for several cases

* With different possible clues we could observe

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/ptmanyex.png")
```



## Process tracing to answer a pathway question

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* Similar idea for answering a pathway question
* Observing $M$ can help us figure out *how* $I$ caused $D$
* Once we provide population-level beliefs about causal effects

## Other pieces of evidence

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px", fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pimddag.png")
```

* $P$ can also be informative about $I$'s effect on $D$
* Will depend on our population-level beliefs about $P$'s effects on $D$ and interactions with $M$


# Process tracing with causal models

## Where the model helps

* The DAG tells us what we can possibly observe
* We will have seen some nodes before we process trace (e.g., outcome, possible causes)
* We can then observe any other node on the DAG
* What we learn about the **case** from observing a node depends on our beliefs about how things work in the **population**
    * What kinds of effects are most and least common?
* How strongly our beliefs shift depends on how different those probabilities are
    * How *much* more common are linked positive effects than linked negative effects, for instance?


## More formally


* We can figure out from the causal model *which* causal types are consistent with our query
* We can figure out from the causal model *which* causal types are consistent with our data we observe
* If we have probabilities for each of these we can figure out the probability of the query given the data

## From the DAG alone...

We can tell when some evidence might *potentially* matter

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/possibly_informative.jpg")
```




## From a full model...

We can say much more... actually making (model dependent) inferences

## Process tracing with causal models

Key advantages of using a causal model:

* Makes clear how process tracing is always theory-dependent
* Provides a way of systematically integrating background knowledge (theory) into inference
* Makes highly explicit/transparent how we get from evidence to conclusions
* Enhances evaluability of findings
    * If I have different background beliefs from you, I can work out how my conclusions from same evidence would be different



<!-- ## Think of process tracing as **updating** -->

<!-- We start with a set of beliefs:  -->

<!-- * For $M$ that: -->
<!--     * $\lambda^M_{00}$ = 0.5 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^M_{01}$ = 0.3 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^M_{10}$ = 0.1 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^M_{11}$ = 0.1  -->

<!-- * For $D$ that: -->
<!--     * $\lambda^D_{00}$ = 0.15 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^D_{01}$ = 0.6 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^D_{10}$ = 0.1 -->
<!--     * $\lambda^D_{11}$ = 0.15 -->

<!-- * Probability of linked positive effects = $0.18$ -->

<!-- * Probability of linked negative effects = $0.01$ -->

<!-- * Probability of ANY positive $I \rightarrow D$ effect = $0.18 + 0.01 = 0.19$  -->
